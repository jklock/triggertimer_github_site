2. The Watch will automatically enter companion mode
3. Watch captures biometrics while iPhone handles timing
4. Data syncs when session ends

---

## Shot Detection

The Watch uses its microphone to detect dry-fire trigger clicks.

### Detection Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sensitivity** | Adjustable via iPhone app |
| **Minimum Interval** | Prevents double-detection |

### Best Practices

1. **Quiet environment** — Background noise affects accuracy
2. **Watch position** — Keep on your non-dominant wrist
3. **Consistent clicks** — Steady trigger pulls improve detection
4. **Train Click Signature** — Use Click Training to calibrate detection for your specific gun

---

## Click Training

Improve shot detection accuracy by training your Watch to recognize your gun's unique click sound.

### How Click Training Works

1. Open **Settings** on your Watch
2. Scroll to **Click Training**
3. Tap **Train Click Signature**
4. Follow the prompts to dry-fire several times
5. The Watch learns your gun's audio signature
6. Detection accuracy improves for future sessions

### Training Tips

- Use the same gun you train with regularly
- Train in a quiet environment
- Perform 10-20 consistent trigger pulls
- The progress indicator shows training completion
- Trained signatures sync to your iPhone

### When to Retrain

Retrain your Click Signature when:

- Switching to a different gun
- Detection accuracy decreases
- Training environment changes significantly

---

## Heart Rate Tracking

During training, the Watch captures:

- **Real-time heart rate**
- **Heart rate at shot** (captured per repetition)
- **Workout session** (HealthKit integration)

### Viewing Heart Rate Data

1. End your session
2. Open Session Details on iPhone
3. View the "Watch Data" section
4. See heart rate correlation with shot times

---

## Syncing Data

### Automatic Sync

Sessions recorded on the Watch sync automatically when:

- Watch and iPhone are connected
- Both apps are running or in background
- Sync completes within seconds

### Manual Sync

If data doesn't appear:

1. Open TriggerTimer on both devices
2. Wait a few seconds for sync
3. Check iPhone Sessions tab

### Offline Mode

If Watch loses iPhone connection:

1. Sessions are stored locally on Watch
2. Sync occurs when connection resumes
3. No data is lost

---

## Troubleshooting

### Shots Not Detected

1. Check Watch microphone isn't obstructed
2. Increase sensitivity in iPhone settings
3. Reduce background noise
4. Ensure Watch is properly positioned

### Heart Rate Missing

1. Verify Watch is snug on wrist
2. Check HealthKit permissions
3. Wait 10-15 seconds for heart rate to stabilize
4. Green LED should be visible

### Sync Not Working

1. Check Watch-iPhone Bluetooth connection
2. Open app on both devices
3. Wait for sync indicator
4. Restart both apps if needed

---

## Limitations

- Watch mic is less accurate than SG Timer
- No shot detection during phone calls
- Battery drain during extended sessions
- Heart rate sampling may have gaps

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Fresh battery** — Charge Watch before training
2. **Snug fit** — Loose Watch affects heart rate accuracy
3. **Consistent environment** — Same location reduces variables
4. **Review data** — Look for patterns in heart rate vs. performance
