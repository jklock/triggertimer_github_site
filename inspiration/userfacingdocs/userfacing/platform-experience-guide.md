## Your Training, Your Way

TriggerTimer is designed around one core principle: **your iPhone or iPad is your training hub**. Everything else is optional. Whether you're training with high-tech gear or just your device and imagination, TriggerTimer adapts to your setup.

- More comfortable review of session history

Choose whichever device suits your training environment — the experience is the same, just bigger on iPad.
